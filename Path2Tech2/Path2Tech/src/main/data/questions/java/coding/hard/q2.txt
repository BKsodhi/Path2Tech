Question: Write a program to determine if a string can be segmented into words from a given dictionary.

Description:
- Given a string s and a dictionary of words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.
- You need to return true if the string can be segmented into one or more dictionary words, otherwise return false.

Input:
- A string s (1 <= |s| <= 1000).
- A list of dictionary words (1 <= |dictionary| <= 1000).

Output:
- Return a boolean value `true` if the string can be segmented into words from the dictionary, otherwise return `false`.

Example:
Input: s = "applepie", dictionary = ["apple", "pie"]
Output: true
Explanation: The string can be segmented as "apple pie".

Input: s = "catsanddog", dictionary = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"]
Output: true
Explanation: The string can be segmented as "cats and dog".
