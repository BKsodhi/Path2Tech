Description:
- Given a non-negative integer n, write a program to calculate the factorial of n (denoted as n!).
- Factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
- For example, 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

Input:
- A single integer n (0 <= n <= 20).

Output:
